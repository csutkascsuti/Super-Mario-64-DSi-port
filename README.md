# Super-Mario-64-DSi-port
I'm not the creator of this port, I just complied to make it easier for beginners to download.
Original creator: Hydr8gon, all thanks to him :)

INSTRUCTIONS:
On your SD card, just paste the file where you store your games and you should be good to go :)
Note: if you have an older version of TwilightMenu++ the game may not boot.
      In this case, open Unlaunch options and set the game to boot on startup and it should work.
