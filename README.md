# Super-Mario-64-DSi-port
I'm not the creator of this port, I just complied to make it easier for beginners to download.
Original creator: Hydr8gon, all thanks to him/her :)

INSTRUCTIONS:
On your SD card, just paste the file where you store your games and you should be good to go :)

Note: The game uses libfat to save to a file just like the PC port. In some cases, there are issues launching the game from TWiLightMenu with libfat enabled; if you have no other way of launching homebrew, it can be disabled in the makefile by removing -DLIBFAT. If you choose to do this, you won't be able to use saves.
